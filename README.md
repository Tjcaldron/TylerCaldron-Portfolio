# Overview

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the use of coding language and compilers, using Python, Erlang, Java, C#, Visual Studio, and Github.
It is a pretty simple way to do it, but it demonstrates the usefulness that such programs have when coding.



# Work projects

I've included screenshots from two of my work projects, since they were made on DoD property I was unable to properly display them. 
They were created in Microsoft PowerApps and are a calendar designed to track upcoming trainings and sign up for them. 
The Perstat application was used to track employee status during the day and whether or not they have logged on or are in the office.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used for this assignment were the VS Code program and GitHub. 
The language that I used for the code was Python v.3.9 64-bit
